# Tailwind CSS Flex Container Collapse on Image Load Failure

This repository demonstrates a potential layout issue in Tailwind CSS when using flex containers and images. If the image fails to load, the flex container might collapse, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided HTML uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a simple profile card with an image. If the image fails to load, the `img` element will have no width or height, causing the flex container to collapse and potentially disrupting the layout of other elements.

## Solution

The provided solution adds `min-w-[12px] min-h-[12px]` to the `img` element, ensuring that the image always occupies a minimum space. This prevents the flex container from collapsing even if the image fails to load.
